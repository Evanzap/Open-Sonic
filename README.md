# Open Sonic (Formerly Sonic-Joe-Engine)
sonic engine im working on.

Engine is far from usable right now, check back on this project in a month and see if it's usable.

DO NOT WORRY, the engine is still being worked on. I just haven't posted the updates here in a while.

Thank you Sonic Retro for the Sonic Physics Guide, I've always wanted to make a Sonic Engine and this wouldn't be possible without this guide.

Engine made with Lua framework: Love2D
https://love2d.org/

Made because of the complexity of other Sonic Engines. (they don't use lua (the only programming language i know is lua))

# Documentation

Open the engine folder with Love2D either with drag and drop or via command lines. Other methods work too, such as with Love2D MSVC extensions.

Currently the engine has a W.I.P. implementation of the Sonic physics.
